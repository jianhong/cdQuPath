Description: This package introduces the basic workflow for spatial phenotyping,
    cell type annotation, multi-nucleus detection, quality control, 
    and calculating cell neighborhoods from whole slide 
    images of ultra-high multiplexed tissue imaged by 'Akoya Biosciences' assays.
    The basic workflow makes use of QuPath, StarDist, Cellpose, Seurat, and 
    hoodscanR.
